Demo of simple car driving physics without the use of a physics library.

The demo allows to accelerate (W) and brake (S), to steer (A, D) and to change gears (UP, DOWN).

Gears are Reverse, Neutral, 1 to 5. You can drive in reverse and put the car in neutral.

Limitations are due to not having an underlying physics model:
- This demo assumes a completely flat terrain, there is no collision detection.
- Note that the car does not lean in a curve and does not lean forward when braking or lean backward when accelerating.
- There is a fake understeer effect to avoid turning very fast at high speed (by clamping the car rotation speed).
- There is no oversteer effect, the tires have perfect grip. You cannot do wheel spin.

To develop this into a racing game, you would need to combine it with a physics library such as Bullet.



## Platforms

-  Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3.
